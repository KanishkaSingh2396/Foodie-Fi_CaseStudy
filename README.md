# Foodie-Fi_CaseStudy

--A. Customer Journey
--Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
```sql
SELECT customer_id, p.plan_id, start_date, plan_name
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
join foodie_fi.plans p
on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
order by customer_id, plan_id, start_date
```

--Part B: Data Analysis Questions

Question 1 How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

```sql
select count(distinct customer_id) from foodie_fi.subscriptions
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89623051/142484773-4293e10e-2c48-4ec9-8612-bb64ee8ee931.png)

Question 2 What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

```sql
select
  DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', start_date) as month_start_date,

from foodie_fi.subscriptions
where plan_id = 0
group by month_start_date
order by month_start_date
```

Question 10 Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

```sql
CREATE Temp TABLE interval(
   month_interval int,
   breakdown_period varchar)
INSERT INTO interval (month_interval, breakdown_period)

  end) as month_interval,
  count(*) as customers

select breakdown_period, customers

```sql

Part B Challenge Payment Question
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

```sql
with base as (
select* from foodie_fi.subscriptions where plan_id != 0 and  date_part ('year', start_date) = 2020 order by customer_id, start_date),
lead_plans as(select*, 
  lead(plan_id) over( partition by customer_id order by start_date) as lead_plan_id,
  lead(start_date) over(partition by customer_id order by start_date)as lead_start_date
from base )

select plan_id, lead_plan_id, count(*) from lead_plans group by plan_id, lead_plan_id ORDER BY plan_id, lead_plan_id;
```
