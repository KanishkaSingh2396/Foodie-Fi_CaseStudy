--Part B: Data Analysis Questions

--Question 1 How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

  count(plan_id)
from foodie_fi.subscriptions
where plan_id = 0
group by month_start_date

--Question 3 What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
select  
  p.plan_id,
  plan_name,
  count(*) as events

-- Part BChallenge Payment Question
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
--monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
--upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
--upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
--once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
